🚀 Objective

The goal of this project is to process the bank-full.csv dataset, clean and analyze the data, engineer features, prepare it for modeling, and build a predictive model. This document provides a structured roadmap of all the steps involved.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Include the libraries and tools that will be used: Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc. Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or other preferred environments.

📊 Steps & Workflow

Step 1: Load the Data

Goal: Import the data into the environment for further processing. Actions: Load the dataset into the working environment. Preview and inspect the structure of the data.

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Goal: Ensure data integrity by removing inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates. Actions: Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle missing data. Remove Duplicates: Eliminate any repeated rows in the dataset. Standardize Text Formatting: Standardize categorical variables to ensure uniformity.

Assess the Columns for "Unknown" Values Contact & poutcome: If their proportion of "unknown" values > 30%, evaluate their impact on the target variable (y). If minimal impact is found, these columns can be dropped entirely. Job & Education: Rows with "unknown" values should be removed if they're likely crucial for prediction. Strategy for Handling "Unknown" Values Replace with Mode: If < 10% of the data has "unknown," replace missing values with the mode (most frequent value). Remove Rows/Columns: If > 30% of the data contains "unknown," consider dropping the rows or the entire column.

Impact Evaluation: Chi-Square Tests Objective: Determine statistical relationships between selected features (contact and poutcome) and the target variable y. Method: Perform Chi-Square Tests to determine association. p-value < 0.05: Statistically significant relationship. p-value > 0.05: Minimal/no impact on the target variable.

Verify Cleaning After addressing all "unknown" values, validate that the cleaning steps were successful.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Understand the data, relationships between variables, and identify trends. Actions: Summarize numerical and categorical variables. Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends. Identify outliers.

Example: Visualize age distributions using histograms or boxplots for better interpretation.

Step 4: Feature Engineering

Goal: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. Actions: Group numerical data into categories (e.g., create age groups). Generate interaction features (e.g., combining balance_per_campaign features). Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Step 5: Data Transformation

Goal: Prepare the data for model training by transforming features and addressing class imbalances. Actions: Scaling: Standardize numerical features for uniformity. Handle class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE or oversampling.

Step 6: Split the Data

Goal: Divide the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model. Actions: Split the data into: 80% Training Set 20% Testing Set

Step 7: Model Selection Goal: Choose an appropriate algorithm based on the problem type and dataset characteristics. Actions: Select initial algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests). Use cross-validation to compare performance.

Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning

Goal: Optimize the model’s performance by fine-tuning its parameters. Actions: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters.

Step 9: Model Evaluation

Goal: Evaluate the model on the testing data. Actions: Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for evaluation. Visualize performance using confusion matrix and ROC curve. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Step 10: Interpret Results

Goal: Understand which features contributed most to the model's predictions. Actions: Feature importance for tree-based models. Coefficients for linear models.

The following metrics were consistently used across all models to compare their performance:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified samples.

Best Performing Model: Based on [specific metric, e.g., ROC-AUC], [model name] achieved the best performance.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

KNN: Simple but less effective for larger datasets or imbalanced classes.

Random Forest: Strong baseline with high performance across most metrics.

XGBoost: Performed best in [specific metric, e.g., Recall], likely due to effective handling of class imbalance via scale_pos_weight.

Conclusion
The comparison highlights [best model] as the most effective algorithm for this task. Future steps include fine-tuning hyperparameters further and exploring additional ensemble methods to improve performance.

**Objecitve:**

The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (y) using three classification models: KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models are evaluated and compared to identify the most suitable one for the task.

Lower precision (0.48) compared to Random Forest but outperformed in F1-Score (0.59).


**Conclusion:**

Random Forest has the highest overall accuracy and balanced performance across all metrics.
XGBoost is the best for recall, making it ideal when identifying positive cases is critical.

**Recommendations :**

We can XGBoost for scenarios requiring high recall (e.g., minimizing false negatives).
Random Forest is suitable for general-purpose tasks with high accuracy and balanced metrics.
